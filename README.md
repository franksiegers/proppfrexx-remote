# proppfrexx-remote
Example settings for Proppfrexx playout software with D&amp;R Airlite mixer

This project is inspired by and based upon the work of [Benjamin Hartwich](https://github.com/benhartwich/proppfrexx-remote).

I've made numerous changes to Benjamins presets which are explained in detail on my blog [radiotech.nl](https://www.radiotech.nl).
